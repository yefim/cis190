1. I have taken CIS 120, CIS 121, CIS 160, CIS 191, and CIS 330.
2. I have never written a line of C++ but I have written a bit of C and a lot of Java.
3. I am taking this class to get a good grasp on a new language. I want to feel comfortable programming in C++.
4. I run Linux Mint, although I have a netbook that runs both Chromium OS and Crunchbang Linux.
5. I vim. A lot. I vim so much that I have forgotten how to type normally. :w
6. I speak Russian rather fluently, so feel free to use me as a translator when negotiating with Commies.
